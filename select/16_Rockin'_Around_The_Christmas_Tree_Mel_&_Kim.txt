Christmas coming around again, eh?
Yeah, I mean, it must be nearly a year since the last one
Oh, it's a good 12 months
Yeah, yeah
You getting anything for your Granny this year?
Well, I thought about it, I couldn't be bothered
Well, it's the thought that counts, ain't it?
Yeah, that's how I see it

What do you fancy for Christmas, then?
Kim Wilde as usual, kidding myself though, aren't I?
It's hopeless, really, it's pathetic, I suppose in a way
It is, yeah, hello, who is this?
Merry Christmas, Melvin
It can't be
Come on, Mel, how about pulling a cracker?
Hah! By the look of you, darling, I think I already have, get it?

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
At the Christmas party hop
Mistletoe hung where you can see
Every couple try to stop (come on, Melly-pops)

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Let the Christmas spirit ring
Later, we'll have some pumpkin pie
And we'll do some caroling (pumpkin pie, anyone?)

You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear
Voices singing, "Let's be jolly
Deck the halls with boughs of holly"

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday (this is so corny)
Everyone's dancing merrily
In the new old-fashioned way

Wow! I am in the most almighty Christmas groove
I haven't had this much fun since "Two Little Boys" was number one
If my friends could see me now, how do I look?
Ridiculous (in the new)
You little tease (old-fashioned way)
A dance, Kimberley?

I do love a nice sax break
Yeah, me too Kim, but let's wait 'til the record's over
Kim, do you think our love will last forever?
No
Couple of years maybe?
No
Do you think we'll make it to the end of the record?
How long is that exactly?
Hm

You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear
All together now
Voices singing, "Let's be jolly
Deck the halls with boughs of holly"

Excuse me, can I sing something now?
Get lost, Griff
Well, that's nice

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Let the Christmas spirit ring (root beer, anyone?)
Later, we'll have some pumpkin pie
And we'll do some caroling (there's plenty of pumpkin pie left, by the way)

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
Do you mind, Melvin?
Everyone's dancing merrily
In the new (new, old) old-fashioned way

Wow! Yeah! That was fantastic
Hm, very nice
Let's do it again, one, two, three, four
Strewth
Five!

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday (ugh)
(Yep, he overdid it with the pumpkin pie)
Everyone's dancing merrily
In the new (new, old) old-fashioned way

Merry Christmas everybody!
Merry Christmas everybody!
Bye Mel, it's been really interesting
I'll tell you who I fancy for Christmas
Who's that?
Bananarama
Yeah, can't help you there, I'm afraid
Oh, thanks a bundle
