Rockin' around the Christmas tree
At the Christmas Party Hop
Mistletoe hung, where you can see
Every couple tries to stop
Well, rockin' around the Christmas tree
Let the Christmas spirit ring
Maybe you'll come and dance with me
And we'll do some caroling
Well, you will get a sentimental feeling
When you hear
Voices singing "Lets be jolly"
Deck the halls with boughs of holly
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
Oh, everyone's dancing happily
In the new old-fashioned way
Well, you will get a sentimental feeling
When you hear
Oh, voices singing "Lets be jolly"
Deck the halls with boughs of holly
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
Yeah, everyone's dancing happily
In the new old-fashioned way
Hey, yeah!
Well, you will get a sentimental feeling
When you hear
Voices singing "Lets be jolly"
Deck the halls with boughs of holly
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
Everyone's dancing happily
In the new, old-fashioned way
